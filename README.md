# Speech Recognition Command Classifier
Project contributors: Filip Kopyt, Julia Czosnek
# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and classify command audio files into specific categories using deep learning techniques. The main objective is to explore different neural network architectures and evaluate their performance in speech recognition tasks.
# Neural Network Architectures

The project involves training and testing three neural networks:

- 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Custom-built model using 2D convolutions.
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Custom-built model using 1D convolutions.
- Pre-trained Model: A third network with a different architecture, potentially leveraging a pre-trained model.

Training and Evaluation

- The networks will be trained on a dataset of audio command files.
- Various parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and activation functions, will be analyzed to evaluate their impact on the training process and the final model performance.
- After selecting the best-performing models, we will analyze their limitations and assess how well they perform in different real-world scenarios.
